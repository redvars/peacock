        The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive
        disclosure.
        The user gets key details about the underlying content and can choose to expand that content
        within the
        constraints of the accordion.
        Accordions work especially well on mobile interfaces or whenever vertical space is at a premium.
