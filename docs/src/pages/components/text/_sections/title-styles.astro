<p class='text-body-large'>
  Titles are smaller than headline styles, and should be used for medium-emphasis text that remains relatively short. For example, consider using title styles to divide secondary passages of text or secondary regions of content.

<p class='text-body-large'>
  For titles, use caution when using expressive fonts, including display, handwritten, and script styles.
