Peacock gives you the tools and foundation to build beautiful, usable product interfaces. It’s the system you use to craft your own component library.

## What is Peacock?
Peacock is more than just a collection of components; it is an aesthetic philosophy. Like its avian namesake, it provides the core elements (the primitives) that allow the full, vibrant display (the design) to be unveiled.

**Opinionated Beauty:** We deliver pre-styled, beautiful components that follow modern design trends, significantly reducing the boilerplate needed to achieve a professional look.

**Foundation First:** Similar to projects like `shadcn/ui`, Peacock focuses on providing the foundational primitives, ensuring maximum flexibility for customization without sacrificing initial polish.

**Seamless Integration:** Designed with modern web frameworks in mind (e.g., React, Vue), integrating Peacock into your existing project structure is fast, efficient, and empowering.

## Key Features
Vibrant & Consistent Design System: Every component—from buttons and cards to complex data tables—shares a cohesive, high-quality visual language.

**Highly Extensible:** The component structure is designed for easy overwriting and theme customization, allowing you to quickly adapt the style to your specific brand identity.

**Built for Accessibility:** Focus on semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes to ensure that your beautiful interfaces are accessible to all users.

**Responsive by Default:** Components are built with responsiveness baked in, guaranteeing a graceful display across all screen sizes and devices.
