      The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive
      disclosure.
      The user gets key details about the underlying content and can choose to expand that content
      within the
      constraints of the accordion.
      Accordions work especially well on mobile interfaces or whenever vertical space is at a premium.
